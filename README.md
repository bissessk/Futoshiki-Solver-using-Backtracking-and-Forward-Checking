# Futoshiki-Solver-using-Backtracking-and-Forward-Checking
This project solves a Futoshiki Board given an input files using the least number of moves. Backtracking, forward checking, the mrv heuristic, and the degree heuristic was used.
There are two python (`.py`) files needed to solve the Board. 

1. `PuzzleObjects.py`
2. `IntelligenceMain.py`

The 3 input files and the 2 python files must be in the same directory. The *“main”* file was named `IntelligenceMain.py`. Open that file using an IDE that runs `Python3`.

After running the Python File, 3 output files should now appear in your directory that corresponds to the 3 Input files. These output files contain the solutions.
